# typed-adventureland

This repository contains type definitions for the game [Adventure Land](https://adventure.land).

**The project is currently in an alpha stage.**  
We know a lot of things are missing and we are still in the process of figuring things out.  
Feel free to ask for missing/convenient types or suggest changes through [Github Issues](https://github.com/adventureland-community/typed-adventureland/issues).  
You can also get in touch with either `thmsn#6385` or `Telokis#1111` on the official game Discord. Preferably in the [dedicated thread](https://discord.com/channels/238332476743745536/1014762228530040902).

Initially based on https://github.com/BegLand/types-adventureland

# Installation
`npm install --save-dev typed-adventureland`

Once you have installed the package, you have to tell TypeScript to use it. It's pretty simple: add `"./node_modules/typed-adventureland"` to the `"include"` array of your `tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json`.  
Please take a look at [the examples](./examples/) if you are unsure.
